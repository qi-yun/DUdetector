# What is DUdetector?
DUdetector is A Dual-granularity Unsupervised Model for Network Anomaly Detection by employing *Ehanced Transformer* and Conv1d&MaxPool1d AutoEncoder with residual connection
(abbr., CM&RC-AE) to realize a dual-granularity learning from the perspective of segments and points, respectively.
