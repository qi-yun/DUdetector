# What is *DUdetector*?
*DUdetector* is a dual-granularity unsupervised model for network anomaly detection, utilizing an *Ehanced Transformer* and a Conv1d&MaxPool1d AutoEncoder with residual connections
(abbr., *CM&RC-AE*) to perform both coarse-grained segment-level and fine-grained point-level detection.
