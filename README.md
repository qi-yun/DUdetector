# What is *DUdetector*?
*DUdetector* is A Dual-granularity Unsupervised Model for Network Anomaly Detection by employing *Ehanced Transformer* and Conv1d&MaxPool1d AutoEncoder with residual connection
(abbr., *CM&RC-AE*) to realize coarse-grained segment-level and fine-grained point-level detection.
